## Hi there 👋



**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ Klooje is a data API designed to simplify data collection through the omnibus data standard
🌈 Please submit pull requests to contribute to this repo!
👩‍💻 Documentation is lacking! Please documen what you see
🍿 Fun fact - klooje is a photetic spelling of kludge - an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a particular purpose.
🧙 Take care of data like a wizard with klooje!

To install you need to clone both node (api) and client

```npm run dev``` to start the api over port 80

```npm run start``` to start the client over port 3000
