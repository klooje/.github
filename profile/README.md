👩‍💻 Documentation is lacking! Please documen what you see

🍿 Fun fact - klooje is a photetic spelling of kludge - an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a particular purpose.

🧙 Take care of data like a wizard with klooje!

**Getting Started:**
To install you need to clone the node (api) repository
1. Connect to VPN (for DocumentDB access)
2. `npm run dev` to start the API on port 3000
3. Use the production client at https://test.klooje.belieflab.yale.edu/home

The client connects to your local API for development/testing.
